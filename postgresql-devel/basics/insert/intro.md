We've seen the INSERT statement in earlier courses so we know by now that it 
is used to add new rows of data to a table.

In this course, we'll dive a little deeper into the nuances of INSERT. For 
example, what happens if you attempt to add a value that violates a constraint?
 We'll also try to place INSERT within the broader context of application 
 processing. 

In this scenario, we'll log you in to a database called `workshop` where some 
tables have already been created and data has been loaded in. You'll be logged 
in as a user with all the necessary privileges to add new data to a table, as 
well as query existing tables. 

We're structuring this course around the example of a career counseling agency 
we've called Extra Mile Counseling. If you did the [Advanced Data Types](https://learn.crunchydata.com/postgresql-devel/courses/basics/advdatatype)
 course, you'll be familiar with the example data model. Otherwise, if you'd 
like to get quickly caught up, feel free to run through that course before 
continuing with this one.
