## Conclusion

In this course, we dove a little bit into three of Postgres' most 
commonly used built-in data types: character, numeric, and date/time.

It's important to have planned out your database stucture first before 
creating new tables and adding data to them. This can save you time and effort 
further down the line.

### Documentation

Here are the links to the official PostgreSQL docs, which contain more details 
about the implementation of the different data types:

2. [Numeric types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html)
3. [Date/time types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html)
