If you're a developer, you know what arrays are

It's a list
You can slice
There's array operators and functions you can take advantage of

It's a bit of difference:
Elements in array have to all be the same type
You can specify exact size of array but Postgres doesn't actually enforce
You can index (won't cover, but GIN and GIST?)

Recommended for what kind of data?

### Declare array type

### Insert an array literal

### Query an array type

### Some simple useful functions

### Go back to discussion of when to use array vs do something else
