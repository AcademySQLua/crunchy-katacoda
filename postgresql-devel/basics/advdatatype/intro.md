- Continuation of basic data types course (finish that one if you need the 
refresher)
- "Advanced" because it's useful to at least know what the more basic native 
data types are, and because they have some more nuanced/specific use cases
- We'll mention some related functions and operators, but not much because 
those should really go in its own scenario
- Not the definitive guide to these data types! This is just an introduction 
to get a feel for how these data types function and how they're used
