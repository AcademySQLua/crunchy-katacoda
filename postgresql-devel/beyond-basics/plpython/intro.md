This scenario gives you a quick introduction to using Python as an embedded langauge in PostgreSQL. The database has already been started and Python has been installed into the learning environment as well. 

While it's not required, we recommend doing the [Basics of PostgreSQL Functions](https://learn.crunchydata.com/basic-postgresql-devel/basicfunctions) scenario before doing this one. 

Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the `postgres` user)
1. A database named: workshop

We will _not_ be going in depth in Python or PL/Python - just enough to whet your appetite.
