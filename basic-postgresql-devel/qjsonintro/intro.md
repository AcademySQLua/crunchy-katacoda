# Using JSON(B) in PostgreSQL

This class gives you a quick introduction to using JSON(B) in PostgreSQL. The database has already been started and JSON data from Natural Events (such a wildfire and storms).  

Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop

We will _not_ be going in depth on JSON in PostgreSQL. We are just going to cover enough to whet your appetite.
